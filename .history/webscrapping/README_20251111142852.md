# Webscrapping Module

This module is used to discover relevant videos (specifically makeup tutorials) that match a user's distinct facial features and traits.

Version 1 focuses on scrapping Youtube videos that match certain facial features that can be categorised into the following:

- Eye Shape: { Almond / Round / Monolid / Hooded / Upturned / Downturned }
- Nose: { Narrow / Medium / Wide}
- Mouth / Lips: { Thin / Medium / Full }

## Key takeaways and improvements

Version 1.1

- low cost of 2800 units vs 10,000 units of free daily limit
- difficulty getting high scores (match > 1 feature) and key words were not specific ("wide" misconstrued as face width rather than nose width)
